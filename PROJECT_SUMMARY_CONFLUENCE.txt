h2. Document Information
* _Project Name:_ ServiceNow Event-Driven Integration
* _Document Type:_ Project Summary
* _Version:_ 1.0
* _Date:_ [Current Date]
* _Status:_ Documentation Phase - Pending Approval

----

h2. 1. Project Overview

This project aims to integrate JIRA, GitHub, Ansible Automation Platform, and Azure Red Hat OpenShift with ServiceNow using an event-driven architecture. The integration will automatically create change requests and incident tickets in ServiceNow based on events from these tools, with reliable event processing, acknowledgment mechanisms, and resilience to ServiceNow outages.

h3. 1.1 Business Value

* _Automation:_ Reduce manual ticket creation by 50%+
* _Speed:_ Create tickets within 1 minute of event occurrence
* _Reliability:_ Ensure no events are lost, even during ServiceNow outages
* _Visibility:_ Provide bidirectional tracking between source systems and ServiceNow
* _Efficiency:_ Streamline incident and change management processes

----

h2. 2. Documentation Structure

This project documentation consists of the following documents:

h3. 2.1 Tool Analysis and Alerting ({{TOOL_ANALYSIS_AND_ALERTING.md}})
_Purpose:_ Comprehensive analysis of how each tool manages events and generates alerts

_Contents:_
* Event types and triggers for each tool
* Alerting mechanisms (webhooks, APIs, notifications)
* Event payload structures
* Conditions and scenarios for each tool
* Common event patterns and integration requirements

_Key Findings:_
* All tools support webhook-based event delivery
* Event formats vary but can be normalized
* High-volume events from OpenShift require filtering
* Authentication methods differ per tool

----

* Event management layer design (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
* ServiceNow integration patterns
* Resilience and reliability mechanisms
* Security architecture
* Technology stack recommendations

_Key Design Decisions:_
* Event-driven architecture with queue-based resilience
* Apache Kafka recommended for event management
* Health check-based ServiceNow outage detection
* Exponential backoff retry strategy

_Purpose:_ Step-by-step implementation plan with timelines and dependencies

_Contents:_
* 7 phases of implementation (24-34 weeks total)
* Detailed tasks and deliverables for each phase
* Resource requirements and team structure
* Risk management and mitigation strategies
* Success metrics and KPIs
* Communication and change management plans

_Implementation Phases:_

||{code:language=text||collapse=false}||
Source Tools (JIRA, GitHub, Ansible, OpenShift)
    ↓ (Webhooks/Events)
Event Management Layer (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
    ↓ (Normalized Events)
Event Processing Engine
    ↓ (Transformed Events)

{code}

h3. 3.2 Key Components

# _Event Ingestion Service:_ Receives webhooks from source tools, validates and normalizes events
# _Event Queue Management:_ Kafka/RabbitMQ for reliable event storage and processing
# _Event Processing Engine:_ Filters, enriches, transforms, and routes events
# _ServiceNow Integration:_ Creates change requests and incidents via REST API
# _Acknowledgment Handler:_ Sends ServiceNow ticket numbers back to source systems
# _Resilience Layer:_ Handles ServiceNow outages, retries, and dead letter queue

h3. 3.3 Resilience Features

* _Queue-Based Architecture:_ Events stored in queue, not lost during outages
* _Health Checks:_ Continuous monitoring of ServiceNow availability
* _Retry Logic:_ Exponential backoff for failed API calls
* _Dead Letter Queue:_ Manual review of permanently failed events
* _Priority Processing:_ Critical events processed first
